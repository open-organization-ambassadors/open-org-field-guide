# The Open Organization Field Guide

This respository contains files related to [_The Open Organization Field Guide_](https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/field-guide), a community-produced companion to Jim Whitehurst's _The Open Organization_ (Harvard Business Review Press).

## About the book

When he published [_The Open Organization_](https://opensource.com/open-organization/) in 2015, Jim Whitehurst invited a community of readers to do more than just readâ€”he asked them to respond.

Less than a year later, they did. _The Open Organization Field Guide: Practical Tips for Igniting Passion and Performance_ is a community-produced companion to Whitehurst's initial thoughts on the future of work, management, and leadership. 

Licensed for sharing and modification under a Creative Commons license, the book collects cutting-edge ideas about the ways open source values are changing the ways we work, manage, and lead.
